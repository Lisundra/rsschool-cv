## Experience
>While working in digital marketing, I used to design ads and create simple landing pages. I became interested in the layout process and I decided to learn how to create web pages more deeply and find out how it looks from the inside. So I started reading and watching videos from programming courses. 

>As a curious and creative person I love to learn new things every day and constantly upgrade my skills. 
At the moment I’m studying at RS School and looking forward to new challenges.
